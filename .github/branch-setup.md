## Creating the azure-app-service branch

To create the `azure-app-service` branch, run these commands in your local repository:

```bash
# Create and switch to the new branch
git checkout -b azure-app-service

# Push the branch to GitHub
git push origin azure-app-service
```

Alternatively, you can create the branch directly on GitHub:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the branch dropdown (showing "main")
3. Type "azure-app-service" 
4. Click "Create branch: azure-app-service from main"

After creating the branch, it will appear in your Azure App Service deployment center dropdown.
